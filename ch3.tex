\chapter{Methods}
\label{chap:methods}
In this chapter we will first focus on the dataset of artificial stimuli that we use to train our model and briefly on the model from which the original dataset stem from. Followingly we will describe the preprocessing steps that has been done on this dataset to properly work on our model and finally in the major part of this chapter will be focused on our model of the primary visual cortex and its parts.
