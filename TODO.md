# Chapter 1 - Biology of Visual Perception
## Fields Intro
- visual fields - area perceived when the eyes are fixed
    - monocular - visible to one eye
    - `blind spot` - small area that cannot be seen
- color vision - ability to detect different wavelengths of light
    - trichromatic vision (blue, green, red)
    - mainly in the center (cones) -> peripheral areas are mainly for the light detection (rods)
        - center - works well in high illumination
    - rods are evenly distributed across the retina (except the blind spot)

## Image Formation
- curved lens -> light signal is curved

## Retina
- the innermost layer of the eye
- part of CNS
- 5 types of neurons (it would be nice to have the schema there):
    - the visual receptor cells
        - the `rods`
        - the `cones`
    - the `horizontal cells`
    - the `bipolar cells`
    - the `amacrine cells`
    - the `retinal ganglion cells`
- `fovea` - lot of receptor cells but less neurons (they are surround it)
    - results in thinner fovea and thicker surrounding area (the cell bodies of fovea)
        - less better signal from fovea

### Photoreceptors
- rods
    - wide wavelength range (white light - all in one)
    - more sensitive - because of the rhodopsin molecule
- cones
    - specific for wavelength (color)
    - need high illumination levels
- biochemical adaptation to light sensitivity
    - takes some time to adapt for differently illuminated areas

### Visual Processing in Retina
- photoreceptors release high level of glutamate - neurontransmiter
    - affects the activity of the bipolar and horizontal cells
- bipolar - synapses to amacrine and retinal ganglion
- retinal ganglion - exits the eye as optic nerve -> terminates in brain
- direct path contains only: receptor cell -> bipolar cell -> ganglion cell
    - horizontal cell - modulates synaptic activity of receptor cells
        - indirectly affect the signal transmission by bipolar cells
    - amacrine cells - same as horizontal but for bipolar and ganglion
        - affects the signal of the ganglion cells

### Bipolar Cells
- connects multiple photoreceptor cells and summarize information from them (125M -> 10M)
    - also some horizontal cells (but only minority)
- do not generate action potentials 
    - responds to glutamate from receptors with graded potentials (polarization)
- at least 2 types based on glutamate (receptors) responses:
    - `OFF (bipolar) cells` - depolarized by glutamate 
        - detect dark objects in the lighter background
        - depolarize in dark
    - `ON (bipolar) cells`- hyperpolarized by glutamate
        - detect the light objects in the darker background
        - depolarize in light
            - is not result from excitation of presynaptic cell but rather reduction of inhibitory action of glutamate (more light -> less glutamate from photoreceptor)
- receptive fields:
    - circumscribed by the position of the bipolar cell
        - radius depends on the position 
            - based on the population density of receptor cells (near fovea is very small - for cone bipolar cells)
    - concentric receptive fields
        - center has opposite response than the surroundings 
            - e.g. ON cell 
                - light in the center - depolarization
                - surrounding light - hyperpolarization
                - both lighten - something between

### Horizontal Cells
- large receptive field (with surrounding photoreceptor cells)
- serve as surround effect for bipolar cells (is lower than center effect)

### Retinal Ganglion Cells
- exits the eye and concludes the information from surround amacrine cells and bipolar cells -> LGN
    - approx. 3 degrees of visual field
- produces action potentials (voltage-gated)
    - because it needs to travel larger distances than the primary retina sensory cells
- depolarization of bipolar cell -> increased action potentials (hyperpolarization - decrease - inhibition) - excitation
    - also OFF/ON ganglion cells - basically passing the signal from the bipolar
- important for shape and movement of the objects
- two types:
    - `P ganglion cells` - more of them than M cells (100:1)
        - only a few bipolar cone cells
        - slow-adapting, color-sensitive, small-range signal
        - good for presence signaling (not stimulus movement)
    - `M ganglion cells` - larger cells
        - many bipolar synapses
        - more sensitive to center surround brightness differences 
        - rapid adaptation to change of stimuli

### Amacrine cells
- similar to horizontal but one layer below (bipolar concatenation)
- partially signal from bipolar to ganglion
- several function dependent types
