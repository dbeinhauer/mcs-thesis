# Intro
- review the problem description section
    - mainly check the references
- refine the project overview
- refine the results part
- refine the thesis structure part

# CH1
- add pictures:
    - neuron description
    - action potential
        - the diagram in time
        - maybe diagram of the potential propagation and some ion channels
    - myelination and saltatory conduction
    - synaptic transition diagram
        - maybe also inhibitory and excitatory
        - maybe combination of the signals
    - early visual system
        - general structure
    - eye - description
    - retina - diagram of different cells
        - maybe also fovea, blind spot etc.
    - LGN - diagram of the structure and path to V1
    - V1 - layers
        - other paths to different regions
        - location in head
    - retinoscopy - visual field
    - orientation selectivity
        - simple and complex cells
        - orientation map
    - maybe binocularity and direction specificity (not needed imho)
    - diagram of pathways to higher regions

- modeling approaches
    - classical approaches
    - SNNs
    - DNNs
- ML
    - RNNs, LSTMs
    - some techniques
    - Pearson's CC
    - Normalized CC (maybe in results)
# CH2
- problem and solution description

# CH3
- analysis and results


# Chapter 2 - Computational neuroscience
- interdisciplinary field that combines principles of mathematics, 
computer science, biology and inner brain mechanics
- models are critical to understand the system
    - replicable, reliable, highly controlled
    - simplification of the system
    - we can design the system to mimic real-life system - to obtain large amount of data

- computation neuroscience combines mathematics and computer science techniques to understand brain (Abbot).
- typical strategy is modeling:

Overview:
- what is computational neuroscience?
    - we are interested in models.
- typical approaches, most common terms (spikes, spiketrains, trials)
- typical metrics for evaluation
    - Pearsons CC
    - normalized cross-correlation
- modeling approaches (its definitions, drawbacks, advantages)
    - filters
