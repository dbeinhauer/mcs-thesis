  abstract = {Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.},

	abstract = {Understanding the brain{\textquoteright}s perception algorithm is a highly intricate problem, as the inherent complexity of sensory inputs and the brain{\textquoteright}s nonlinear processing make characterizing sensory representations difficult. Recent studies have shown that functional models capable of predicting large-scale neuronal activity in response to arbitrary sensory input can be powerful tools for characterizing neuronal representations by enabling unlimited in silico experiments. However, accurately modeling responses to dynamic and ecologically relevant inputs like videos remains challenging, particularly when generalizing to new stimulus domains outside the training distribution. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, where foundation models{\textemdash}trained on vast quantities of data{\textemdash}have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and generalization, we developed a {\textquotedblleft}foundation model{\textquotedblright} of the mouse visual cortex: a deep neural network trained on large amounts of neuronal responses to ecological videos from multiple visual cortical areas and mice. The model accurately predicted neuronal responses not only to natural videos but also to various new stimulus domains, such as coherent moving dots and noise patterns, as verified in vivo, underscoring its generalization abilities. The foundation model could also be adapted to new mice with minimal natural movie training data. We applied the foundation model to the MICrONS dataset: a study of the brain that integrates structure with function at unprecedented scale, containing nanometer-scale morphology, connectivity with \&gt;500,000,000 synapses, and function of \&gt;70,000 neurons within a \~{} 1mm3 volume spanning multiple areas of the mouse visual cortex. This accurate functional model of the MI-CrONS data opens the possibility for a systematic characterization of the relationship between circuit structure and function. By precisely capturing the response properties of the visual cortex and generalizing to new stimulus domains and mice, foundation models can pave the way for a deeper understanding of visual computation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to give rise to cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses and/or neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term {\textquotedblleft}neural network{\textquotedblright} suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements: input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.},
